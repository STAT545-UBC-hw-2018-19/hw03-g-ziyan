## **This is a high-level exploration on `gapminder` dataset. I would try to implemente the tasks on the Task Menu.**

As usual, load the data first.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

Then, go for the tasks below.

  - **Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all
    continents.**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
df <- gapminder %>% 
  # for each continent
  group_by(continent) %>%  
  summarize(max = max(gdpPercap), min = min(gdpPercap))
  
# show the table in a decent way
knitr::kable(df)  
```

| continent |       max |        min |
| :-------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Africa    |  21951.21 |   241.1659 |
| Americas  |  42951.65 |  1201.6372 |
| Asia      | 113523.13 |   331.0000 |
| Europe    |  49357.19 |   973.5332 |
| Oceania   |  34435.37 | 10039.5956 |

``` r
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent)) + 
  # plot the points in the same graph and differentiate by color
  geom_point(aes(y = max, colour = "max")) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = min, colour = "min")) +  
  ggtitle("The max and min of GDP per capita for all continents")
```

An interesting thing is that Asia has the highest and the lowest GDP per
capita among all continents.

  - **Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(gdpPercap), sd = sd(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| continent |      mean |        sd |
| :-------- | --------: | --------: |
| Africa    |  2193.755 |  2827.930 |
| Americas  |  7136.110 |  6396.764 |
| Asia      |  7902.150 | 14045.373 |
| Europe    | 14469.476 |  9355.213 |
| Oceania   | 18621.609 |  6358.983 |

``` r
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, color = continent)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  # show the distribution of data
  geom_density() + 
  ggtitle("The spread of GDP per capita within the continents")
```

![](hw03_files/figure-gfm/The%20spread%20of%20GDP%20per%20capita%20within%20the%20continents-1.png)<!-- -->

The graph indicates the same conclusion with the first part: Asia has a
hugh variance of GDP per capita and Oceania has a centralized
distribution.

  - **Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or
    a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other
    than the plain vanilla mean.**

Compute the trimmed mean which discard the 10% largest and lowest value.

Life expectancy is constantly increase these years.

  - **How is life expectancy changing over time on different
    continents?**

Use the mean of life expectancy in every continent to represent overall
situation.

``` r
df <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent,year) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(lifeExp))
knitr::kable(df)

  - **Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with

Scatter plot was used here to describe the life expectancy of each
continent compared with the general situation in every year. It can be
concluded that part of countries from Asia and Africa bring down the
benchmark. *I was in trouble to show the variable name of x-axis
completely.*

The linear plot below is to show how the number of countries change,
whose life expectancy is less than the worldwide median for each
continent.

``` r
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = num, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +

![](hw03_files/figure-gfm/The%20number%20of%20low%20life%20expectancy%20countries-1.png)<!-- -->
Except Oceania, the number of countries with low life expectancy has
seen a decrease in every continent over time.

  - **Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and,
    therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged.
    This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.**

Go on with the last task. To make it more meaningful, I decided to use
yearly benchmark for measure, therefore it comes out different
conclusions.

``` r
# compute the median for each year
ww <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  summarise(md = median(lifeExp)) %>% 
  `[[`("md")
# repeat the median for all countries
df <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(md = rep(ww, nlevels(country))) 
# count the number of countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than the median, for each year
df %>% 
  filter(lifeExp < md) %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  count(continent) %>%

Different from the last task, the number of countries with low life
expectancy is basically flat over time among four continents. There is a
little decrease in Asia.
